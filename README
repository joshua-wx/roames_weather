11/4/14: Finish development and testing of ewt methods with working climatology and vis modules
23/4/14: fixed issues with tops/vild thresholds and refined tracking towards optimal performance stats
24/4/14: core: Fixed compass angle averaging bug and added max azi tracking diff criteria. vis: fixed iso issues
26/4/14: Fixed error assocatied with calculating the azi between target tn1 and all tn in tracking pass1 (originally used tn1_proj_lat/lon instead of true tn1 lat lon). Change sorting from track length to vil in wdss_tracking.
28/4/14: Added azi diff check to pass2 in wdss_tracking. Fixed angle wrapping code in wdss_trac. Added maximum track length in project_storm
29/4/14 - 1: Fixed storm projection when timesteps is large. Corrected bug in max_search_dist in wdss_tracking
29/4/14 - 2: Fixed broken nowcast visualisation kml layer
13/5/14 - Removed smooth3 applications in ewt2ident function to prevent smoothing in stats. Moved smooth3 to kml generation scripts. Changed calculation of mean and max dbz in ewtident to use entire 3d volume
21/5/14: Fixed log stats code to give true percentages
22/5/14: Added scripts for generating a subset list of QLD vol files using the log stats (gaps) in the utilities folder. Created script to processed qld arch files into h5.tar daily files.
23/5/14: Added h5.tar.lz4 functionality to wv_process
29/5/14: Added image output for climatology plots
01/6/14: Normalised climatology image outputs (storms/day)
12/6/14: Changes to climatology stat output mat file (not struct arrays). Stats also include track information
13/6/14: remove rainfall stats. changed stats to use extended basin rather than wdss basin.
21/6/14: MAJOR CHANGES: Added cell vil, POSH,MESH (wdss-ii hail grids), snd_data for wv_process
27/6/14: MAJOR CHANGES: clim rebuild for hail
30/6/14: Fixed remaining bugs for clim
10/10/14: Fixing errors in realtime vis (variables etc)
16/02/15: Climatology vis tweak and realtime kml debugging 2
28/10/15: Created matwrapper2 to fix issues with job que. Fixed minor bugs
01/09/16: Started work on new roames project to implement into roames-world and finish national climatology
