Mex wrapper to C++ class for fast reading and writing of JSON files

https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59166-c++-json-io


These function wrap Niels Lohmann's JSON for Modern C++ class into mex wrappers, for fast reading of JSON files into MATLAB variables, and writing MATLAB variables into JSON files.
JSON for Modern C++ must be downloaded separately from:
https://github.com/nlohmann/json

Mex these functions by calling:
   mex json_read.cpp
and
   mex json_write.cpp
Note that your C++ compiler must support C++11.

Example usage: var = json_read(filename)
IN:
   filename - String of filename (if in current directory) or full or relative path to the JSON file to be read in.
OUT:
   var - MATLAB interpretation of the JSON data.
